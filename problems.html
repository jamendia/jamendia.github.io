							<h2>Problems in Semantics</h2>
							<br>
							<p>Model-theoretic truth-conditional semantics is the approach to semantics where the meaning of a sentence
							is determined by the conditions in the world that make the sentence true: <i>S</i> is true <i>iff p</i> is the case in the
							model, false otherwise. Over the past few years, this type of semantic theory has been prevalent in linguistics and has lead to numerous advances in the field. As the fields grows, however, and specially as theories
							of syntax get more complex and integrated with semantics, it has become customary to assume a separate
							level of interpretation LF, where the interpretation of a syntactic structure is represented by means of a logical (or pseudo-logical) metalanguage that is only implicitly understood by readers, rather than explicitly (formally) defined.
							<p>The goal of this class is thus twofold. First, we will begin by looking at the historical context in which
							model-theoretic truth-conditional semantics emerged, paying close attention to the conceptual underpinnings that made it so popular. We will start of by discussing the semantics of well-understood logical languages, and we will progressively enhance them until we reach the rudiments of "baby" Montague Grammar, the semantic framework that sparked the area of research that we know today as Formal Semantics,
							and that is introduced in texts such as Heim and Kratzer (1998), Chierchia and McConnell-Ginet (2000),
							etc. The origins of much of todayâ€™s intellectual landscape in Formal Semantics can be seen in issues that
							emerged in this period, and thus in discussing the fundamentals of Montague Grammar we will gain some
							of the insight that is more difficult to appreciate otherwise.
							<p>Despite its big success in linguistics, truth-conditional semantics is neither problem free nor widely
							adopted by everyone. The idea of meaning as truth-conditions has been scrutinized and criticized on several grounds, and thus the second part of the course will center around discussing and assessing some such
							criticisms. The discussion will take off by considering first some conceptual considerations, such as compositionality and the relation that semantics should bear to syntax, the distinction between object- and meta-
							language, and the "right" notion of truth. We will however pay closer attention to concrete natural language
							phenomena that has been invoked as being problematic for some aspect or other of truth-conditional semantics. Chief among these are presuppositions, vagueness and gradability related phenomena, but we
							will also touch upon conventional implicatures and lexical semantics.
