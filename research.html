		  								This snippet points out that the oddness of sentences like <i>some dogs have four legs</i> does not receive a straightforward explanation in terms of  pragmatic competition with a more informative alternative statement, precisely because of the difficulty to identify what the competiting  more informative alternative statement should be.

									Spanish comparatives have two morphemes that can introduce the standard of comparison: the complementizer "que" ("that") and the preposition "de" ("of"/"from"). This paper defends the idea that comparatives introduced by "de" always express overt comparison to a degree (type <i>d</i>). On this view, a simple analysis where everything is interpreted as it surfaces suffices to account for all the properties of de comparatives. On the other hand, comparatives introduced by the standard que are compatible with a wider range of constructions, suggesting they involve additional covert structure. These findings in turn point to an unnoticed locus of cross-linguistic variation with respect to the role of the standard morpheme.

		  								Although there is no consensus about what kinds are, there is a common understanding that kinds can be regarded as collections of objects that share certain properties. What these properties exactly are is often left unspecified. This paper explores the semantics of <i>ad hoc</i> kind-referring terms, where the determination of the relevant set of shared properties does not rely on “natural” properties or world knowledge. Rather, information provided by a nominal modifier, typically a relative clause, is used to impute the required regular behavior on the kind-referring NP. Building on Carlson’s (1977) disjointness condition, I show that we can not only account for the ubiquity of these expressions, but we can also extend the analysis to other constructions that have traditionally not been taken to be kind-referring, such as Amount and Degree Relative constructions.

		  								Epistemic numbers are syntactically complex numbers formed by some combination of number and (non-numerical) indefinite expressions that convey uncertainty, vagueness or ignorance. I examine these constructions in a number of languages and provide an analysis that capitalizes on independently motivated properties of their two sub-components: epistemic indefinites and complex numerals. I argue that variability in these two components explain the cross-linguistics variability in the nature and interpretation of epistemic numbers across languages.

										Under certain circumstances, speakers are subject to so-called spurious NPI licensing effects, whereby they perceive that NPIs without a c–commanding licensor are in fact licensed and grammatical. Previous studies have all involved the presence of a licensor in a position that linearly precedes, but does not c–command the NPI. In this paper, we show that spurious NPI licensing can occur in the outright absence of a licensor, in contexts that force an exhaustive parse. We reason that at least these instances of spurious NPI licensing might be reduced to the EXH operator pragmatically “rescuing” the NPI, in the sense of Giannakidou (1998, 2006).

									Emphatic Relative Constructions in Spanish (ERCs) are constructions that superficially resemble definite DPs modified by a restrictive relative clause. However, despite their surface appearance, they differ from these in two important respects: <i>(i)</i> they can be embedded under a great variety of <i>wh</i>-embedding predicates. This paper argues that despite their surface appearance, ERCs are subordinate questions: syntactically, they involve an interrogative core that combines with a definite determiner; semantically, the interrogative core yields a question meaning, and the definite determiner returns the most informative proposition from the Hamblin-set delivered by the CP (e.g. Dayal 1996).

									Amount Relatives (ARs) differ from restrictive relative clauses in that they do not refer to a particular object denoted by the head of the relative clause, but to an amount of such objects (Carlson 1977a, Heim 1987). Traditionally, ARs have been regarded as degree expressions. In this paper I argue against this view and propose instead that amount interpretations of relative clauses are in fact a special case of kind interpretation.

									In this short paper I discuss a particular construction of Spanish where numeral expressions (like "twenty-three") contain some kind of vague quantifier (like 'some', 'many' or 'few'; cf. 'twenty-some' in English). I present an sketch of a general system to interpret cardinal numbers flexible enough to account for the variety of quantifiers that can appear in a variety of languages.

									It has long been noted that Superlative Modifiers ("at least" and "at most") can be associated with focus (e.g., Krifka 1999). By using a number of diagnostics from Beaver and Clark (2008) and others, this paper argues that SMs have a lexically-encoded, conventionalized dependency on focus. In this respect, they are unlike other superlatives ("−est"), whose Association with Focus is Free. These claims are substantiated by extensive data from a variety of unrelated languages. The results lend support to Beaver & Clark's (2008) claim that different kinds of focus-sensitive elements interact with the meaning of focus in different ways (i.e., the disctinction between “conventional” <i>vs.</i> "free" association with focus).

									Experimental evidence is presented showing that when "at least" takes a complement that constitutes a Total Order (like numerals), the exhaustive interpretation of the prejacent <b>must</b> obligatorily constitute an epistemic possibility for the speaker. In contrast, when the complement is Partially Ordered, the exhaustive interpretation of the prejacent <b>can but need not</b> be a live possibility for the speaker. These facts are taken to suppor previous neo-Gricean accounts of the Ignorance Inferences that Superlative Modifiers come with (see the paper <i>Structural Effects on Implicature Calculation</i> below).

									In this paper it is argued that computing implicatures with Superlative Modifiers SMs like <i>at least</i> and <i>at most</i> requires to factor in both Horn Set alternatives and focus alternatives. The account formulates a classical neo–Gricean implementation elaborating on the following ideas: that SMs are conventionally associated with focus  (Krifka 1999), and that the alculation of implicatures with SMs requires two sets of alternatives (Mayr 2013, Schwarz 2016). In addition, I propose in the paper that the set of alternatives relevant for the Gricean calculus is provided by two independent mechanisms: the familiar substitution method within elements of a Horn Set (Horn 1972, Sauerland 2004) and Association with Focus, whereby a set of alternatives is obtained by replacing the focus–bearing constituent with contextually relevant alternatives (Rooth 1985; cf. Fox and Katzir 2011).

									<br>
									This paper suggests that non–atomic distributive interpretations of plural quantified NPs are better explained by means of some notion of “typicality”. Sentences of the form <i>all the X are P</i> are predicted to have a non–atomic reading only if <i>X</i> can form a typical group. I suggest that typical groups are conceptually salient sub–pluralities of atomic individuals that, most importantly, are claimed to be relevant for the grammar. Two consequences follow: (i) quantifier–determiners have access to typical groups and (ii) non–atomic distribution over typical groups is context–independent.

									This paper investigates the inferences of ignorance that come with superlative numerals.  I argues that these are better understood as primary implicatures that are derived in a neo–Gricean framework together with a basic epistemic logic. In doing so, the paper supports the view of superlative numerals first advanced by B&uuml;ring (2007), where their ignorance inferences are equal to those of a disjunctive expression, of the form <i>exactly n or more/less than n</i>.

										This paper was writen in 2009/2010 as one of my MA qualifying papers.  It provides evidence that the so-called Taub's Generalization (Taub 1989) holds not only for a variety of QPs, but also in a variety of languages. In the light of these facts, the paper argues against a <i>cover</i>-based semantics for <i>all</i> (<i>pace</i> Brisson 1998, 2003).

									This paper provides an investigation of Ignorance Inferences by looking at the superlative modifier <i>at least</i>. The formal properties of these inferences are characterized in terms of the epistemic conditions that they impose on the speaker, thereby establishing how much <i>can</i> and <i>must</i> be inferred about what the speaker is ignorant about. The paper makes two main contributions. First, it argues that the form of these inferences depends solely on the structural properties of the expression that <i>at least</i> is modifying, which do not necessarily coincide with semantic entailment: with totally ordered associates, <i>at least</i> triggers Ignorance Inferences that may be formally different than those obtained with partially ordered associates (see <a href="javascript:hideshow(document.getElementById('salt-p'))">Mendia 2016a</a>). Second, it builds on neo-Gricean double alternative generation mechanisms (e.g. <a href="https://semprag.org/article/view/sp.9.1">Schwarz 2016</a>) by showing that one of them must be provided by focus alternative semantics.

									There are two main analyses of tough-constructions (TCs): a long movement analysis and a base-generation analysis. The two make different predictions as to whether the matrix subject can reconstruct into the embedded gap position. We focus specially on Longenbaugh's (2015) claim that comparative quantifiers can reconstruct. We show that reconstruction is in fact impossible also with comparative quantifiers and argue that claims on putatitve reconstruction effects are either false or confounded. This result strongly supports a base-generation analysis of TCs (as in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1515/tlr-2017-0003">Keine & Poole 2017</a>).

									<br>
									<br>
									In this paper we address the question of whether characterizing generic statements, such as <i>Birds fly</i> and <i>Sue smokes</i> can be given a unified analysis. We argue for a new point of view, namely the stance that a cognitive agent <i>A</i> has on the exceptions to the generically predicated property <i>P</i>. We argue that <i>A</i>’s stance on exceptions to <i>P</i> systematically correlates <i>(i)</i> with different types of charaterizing generics (Rules & Regularions vs. Inductive; Carlson 1995), and <i>(ii)</i> with different natural language expressions (Q-Adverbs, affixes, i.a.), signaling the type of characterizing generic statement it expresses. Our main evidence comes from the Czech verb suffix -VA-: we argue that -VA- is a morphological marker of inductive generalizations, and, due to its specific lexical semantic properties, it only allows two epistemic attitudes wrt. to exceptions: either <i>A</i> knows for certain that a generalization <i>P</i> has exceptions (hence is not normative), or <i>A</i> is ignorant about whether <i>P</i> has no exceptions. If this hypothesis is right, then this would seem to suggest that we need recognize different subtypes of characterizing statements, providing evidence against a unified treatment (with Krifka 2009, Pelletier 2010, i.a.).

									In Spanish, certain DPs that superficially resemble definite descriptions modified by a relative clause show the syntactic and semantic behavior of interrogatives. I show that unlike concealed questions, these constructions possess full interrogative syntax. I propose a syntactic and semantic analysis of these constructions on which they are garden-variety <i>wh</i>-constructions that are selected by a D-head that is argued to be the overt exponent of an Answer-hood operator à la Dayal (1996).

									Mainstream theories of presupposition (i.e. "satisfaction" theories) propose weak presuppositions that are then pragmatically strengthened under to-be-determined conditions. In this talk I explore the opposite route: presuppositions are semantically strong but can nevertheless be pragmatically weakened. When? When not doing so leads to "pragmatic embarrassment," such as declaring oneself to hold an inconsistent epistemic state.

								This talk focuses on how two aspects of certain quantity implicatures (ignorance inferences of <i>at least</i>): that they can succeed even when the relevant alternative propositions seem to be logically independent, and that the implicatures are subject to different orderings in the domain. The implications are broad: if this reliance on structure can be generalized to other forms of conversational implicature, then issues surrounding the role of logical vs. contextual entailment in implicature calculation no longer arise (cf. Hirschberg 1985, Magri 2011).

									This paper investigates a puzzling pattern in Bangla whereby only concealed questions that denote identity questions about a number/degree/amount are grammatical in the language, while ordinary individual-referring extensions cannot form concealed questions. We provide a domain-restricted individual concept analysis of concealed questions whereby measure DPs are DPs whose denotation makes reference to a nominalized degree, a point in an ordering of sets of entities. Bangla is argued to have a much more restricted type-shifter than its very well-studied English counterpart, and only measure DPs satisfy the restriction. This analysis effectively establishes a categorical difference between ordinary and restricted concealed questions.

									This talk suggests that a key aspect in providing a semantics of characterizing genericity is to factor in the point of view of the speaker's stance on exceptions to the generically predicated property. We argue that the speaker's stance on exceptions systematically correlates (i) with different types of generalizations, and (ii) with different natural language expressions (Q-Adverbs, affixes, i.a.) signaling the type of generalization a sentence expresses.

								This paper presents a syntax and semantics for Degree Neuter Relatives (DNRs) in Spanish, an unusual construction involving a relative clause seemingly headed by a gradable predicate and the neuter determiner <i>lo</i>. I propose an analysis of DNRs that avoids compositionality problems derived from sortal mismatches between degrees and entities. In addition, I suggest that despite the cross-linguistic rarity of DNRs, it is no coincidence that they are available in Spanish: the proposed analysis relies on aspects of the morphological inventory of Spanish that allows the language to construct degree-denoting Free Relatives (FRs) headed by a definite article, and so DNRs should not be expected in languages lacking this ability.

								This dissertation provides a novel analysis of Amount Relatives (Carlson 1977a, Heim 1987, Grosu and Landman 1998, Herdan 2008, Meier 2015, a.o). Amount Relatives are a form of non-intersective relative clause that is usually associated with amount interpretations . For example, the sentence <i>it will take us the rest of our lives to drink the champagne they spilled that evening</i> is most naturally interpreted as referring to an amount of champagne, and not any particular champagne. Previous accounts of Amount Relatives have converged in appealing to degree semantics in order to extract an amount from the relative clause, suggesting that the embedded CP denotes a property of degrees.
								<p>This dissertation advocates a more nuanced view of Amount Relatives across languages. I propose that natural languages allow two different strategies for deriving amount interpretations of relative clauses: a degree-based strategy and a degree-less strategy, where degree semantics does not come into play at all. It is argued that while some languages employ both strategies, as is the case with Spanish, languages like English only have the degree-less strategy, contra much of the previous literature. Evidence for this division comes from the fact that Amount Relatives in Spanish, but not English, pass independently-motivated diagnostics of degree-related operations (e.g. degree-quantification and degree-abstraction).
